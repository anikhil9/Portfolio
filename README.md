# Interactive Web Portfolio with React

### Description:
This project is a responsive web portfolio built using React, showcasing various features such as a navigation bar, an introductory banner, sections for skills, projects, experience, contact details, and a footer. The portfolio is styled using custom CSS and Bootstrap to ensure a modern and clean design.

The main functionality of the webpage includes:

### App Structure:

The app is composed of reusable components such as NavBar, Banner, AboutMe, Skills, Experience, Projects, Contact, and Footer.
Each section provides a different feature of the portfolio, offering a comprehensive showcase of personal and professional information.
User Interface:

Navigation Bar: A fixed navigation bar that transitions as the user scrolls the page.
Banner: A visually striking banner with a background image, introducing the user with a headline and call-to-action buttons.
Skills & Experience: Interactive sections displaying key skills, experience, and achievements.
Projects: A showcase of projects with hover effects and transitions, emphasizing each projectâ€™s title and details.
Contact Section: A contact form and contact details are provided for communication.
Responsive Design:

The layout is fully responsive and works seamlessly across various screen sizes using custom CSS and Bootstrap.
Additional Features:

Stateful Counter (Test Component): A test component demonstrating state management in React, allowing the user to increment a counter.
Testing: Includes test files (App.test.js) using Jest and React Testing Library for basic testing of the app.

Performance Monitoring: The app uses reportWebVitals.js to track and log performance metrics such as First Contentful Paint (FCP) and Largest Contentful Paint (LCP).

This project serves as a foundational example of building a personal portfolio in React, featuring modular components, responsive design, and performance tracking.



### Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
