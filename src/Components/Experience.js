      company: "Optum",
      period: "Oct 2021 - Jul 2023",
      description: "At Optum, I took on the role of a Software Engineer where I led the backend development of the ELGS SaaS Application. Utilizing C#, TopDown CCM, and MS SQL, I applied both functional programming and object-oriented programming techniques to enhance the functionality and performance of the system. I was responsible for architecting a robust .NET Framework application, which included the integration of Swagger API, automating the cleanup of outdated PDF records. This innovation led to significant cost savings, approximately $180,000, by reducing NAS storage purchases by 50%. My role also involved securing RESTful API integrations using token authentication, HTTP TLS 1.2, and JSON parsing to ensure efficient data retrieval. I further enhanced the entityâ€™s microservices by integrating Kafka with the .NET Framework, enabling seamless communication with existing services. By optimizing SQL queries and stored procedures, I boosted performance and reduced loading times by 27%, which greatly improved the system's operational efficiency. In addition, I automated the CI/CD pipeline by integrating .NET code with GitHub, Jenkins, and SonarQube, leading to efficient builds, artifact management, and comprehensive code quality analysis. I was also involved in deploying new production servers and distributing components to reduce the load on existing servers. This enhancement increased our system's capacity to process up to 1,000,000 JSON/XML records per day, transforming raw data into new letter templates. My efforts in leveraging SonarQube for code quality resulted in a 90% code coverage through MSTest Unit Testing.",

      company: "Cognizant",
      period: "Feb 2021 - Aug 2021",
      description: "During my time at Cognizant as a Programmer Analyst Trainee, I engineered and optimized web applications using the Spring Boot framework. This included leveraging its rapid backend development capabilities and REST API integrations to build scalable and efficient applications. I also crafted dynamic, responsive user interfaces using JSP, significantly enhancing the user experience for the Audit Management System. In addition to development, I integrated Spring Security with JWT to ensure secure access control across the application. I was responsible for containerizing the app using Docker, and setting up CI/CD pipelines through AWS CodeCommit and ECS Fargate, which reduced deployment time by 70% and ensured consistent environments across different stages of development. My role also involved active participation in agile development practices, where I contributed to sprint planning, daily stand-ups, and retrospectives, fostering an iterative and collaborative project workflow. These experiences have provided me with a deep understanding of backend development, API security, CI/CD pipeline automation, and agile methodologies. I have honed my skills in both individual and team settings, constantly striving to improve systems' efficiency and security while staying up-to-date with the latest technologies and best practices.",
